This project is intended to provide aggregated results from various automation suites.

It's written in Python 3.6 and uses the Django framework. Ultimately results will 
be served from the database upon nightly regression runs, and formulated into a 
pretty pretty email for those who are interested.

If you have any questions please email gsirois@protonmail.com

**Here is some nice information on django:**

"Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus 
on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source."
